    </header>
    <p>Hi! My name is Nikolas Dibble, and I'm a first-generation college student who's eager to flourish their skills of game design and design in general. I'm currently almost complete with my Associate's Degree in Digital Media, and will be transferring to UCF in 2025 to pursue my BA in Game Design! I've had a burning passion for video games ever since I played my first one, and had a passion for game design once I was able to draw! Being able to bring my characters and thoughts to life is a dream come true, and I hope to share my brilliant and colorful ideas with everyone soon. </p>
